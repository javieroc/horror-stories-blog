      Somewhere between a theorem and a whisper lies this collection:
      pages steeped in old ink, haunted corridors of memory,
      and the strange mathematics of fear.

      A physicist turned chronicler of the macabre tends to this archive —
      Buenos Aires nights, forgotten alleys, and voices  
      buried deep beneath the hum of the city.  
      Here, stories do not merely live… they linger.

        Never laugh when a hearse goes by,<br />
        or you may be the next to die.<br />
        First they wrap you in a big white sheet,<br />
        then they throw you six feet deep.<br />
        It all goes well for about a week,<br />
        then your tomb starts to leak.<br />
        Ants run in, ants run out.<br />
        Ants play pinochle on your spout.<br />
        And then your corpse turns a sickening green,<br />
        and pus runs out like whipping cream.<br />
        So never laugh when hearse goes by,<br />
        or you may be the next to die.
